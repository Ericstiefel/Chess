- Temporal Difference instead of MCTS
Maybe instead of using fully explored lines with MCTS, use BFS with Temporal Difference and use a NN to evaluate the end position while being under a time constraint
Possibly just use this method in bullet, where it wont have time to explore full lines


- Time usage

    Use a lightweight NN to quickly evaluate the time that should be spent on the next move (i.e. use more time in critical positions)
    8x8 -> float
    Min time spent something around a second (using increment)

- Training
    - Originally train a bot for an allotted time, and use it to judge the other training runs, whether to prune or allow to keep training,
    - Predict much like LLM training where you simply see the loss (couple games vs given engine), and look at the results.
